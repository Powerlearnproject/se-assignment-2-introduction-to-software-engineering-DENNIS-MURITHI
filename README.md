Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software developers and engineers to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications. It consists of several distinct phases, each with specific activities and deliverables. Here are the various phases of the SDLC:

1. Planning
Description: This phase involves defining the project goals, scope, and objectives. It includes feasibility analysis, resource allocation, project scheduling, and risk management.
Activities:

2. Requirements Analysis
Description: This phase involves gathering and analyzing the software requirements from stakeholders and documenting them in a detailed manner.
E.g Conducting interviews, surveys, and workshops with stakeholders.

3. Design
Description: This phase focuses on transforming the requirements into a blueprint for building the software. It involves architectural and detailed design.E.g Creating data models and database designs.

4. Implementation (Coding)
Description: In this phase, the actual code for the software is written based on the design documents. Developers translate design specifications into source code.E.g Writing and compiling code as well as Performing unit tests.

5. Testing
Description: This phase involves verifying and validating that the software works as intended and meets the requirements. Various levels of testing are conducted to ensure quality.

6. Deployment
Description: This phase involves releasing the software to the production environment where it will be used by the end users. It includes installation, configuration, and user training.
User manuals and training materials.

7. Maintenance
Description: This phase involves ongoing support and maintenance of the software to fix issues, add new features, and ensure it continues to meet user needs over time. E.g
Monitoring the software for defects and performance issues.
Releasing patches and updates.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the software development process. It includes:

*Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders.
*Specification: Documenting the requirements in detail.
*Validation: Ensuring the requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs.
*Management: Keeping track of changes to requirements over time.
Importance:

*Ensures all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the software should do.
*Helps in creating a roadmap for development.
*Reduces the risk of project failure due to misunderstood requirements.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is the division of a software system into separate, interchangeable modules, each responsible for a specific part of the system's functionality.

Benefits:

*Maintainability: Easier to update or fix individual modules without affecting the entire system.
*Scalability: New modules can be added with minimal impact on existing ones.
*Reusability: Modules can be reused across different projects.
Example: A web application with separate modules for user authentication, data processing, and UI components.

Testing in Software Engineering:
